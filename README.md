## Implementation of Integer Class for Integers with isPositive and negate methods and Unit Test cases.

### Write an implementation Integer of integer numbers.

The implementation should support all operations of class Nat while adding two methods:

### def isPositive: Boolean
### def negate: Integer

The first method should return true if the number is positive. The second method should negate the number. 
Do not use any of Scalaâ€™s standard numeric classes in your implementation. (Hint: There are two possible ways to implement Integer. 
One can either make use of the existing implementation of Nat, representing an integer as a  natural number and a sign. 
Or one can generalize the given implementation of Nat to  Integer, using the three subclasses Zero for 0, Succ for positive numbers, 
and Pred for negative numbers.)
